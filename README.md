# Mommybrain: Computational genomics on the brain post-partum
Spatial Transcriptomics (Slide-seq V2, Slide-Tags) project on Postopartum Depression (PPD). Brains of female rats were sequenced at different stages (nulliparous, pregnant, postpartum), while some animals were treated with corticosterone to mimic the psychiatric symptoms of PPD.  

## Explanation of Methods

**Slide-seq**: a spatial bead can capture 1 or more cells, collecting information from both the cytoplasm and the nucleus

**Slide-tags**: a spatial bead can capture 1 cell only, collecting information from its nucleus

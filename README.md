# Mommybrain_slide_seq
Spatial Transcriptomics (Slide_seq V2, Slide-Tags) project on Postopartum Depression (PPD). Brains of female rats were sequenced at different stages (nulliparous, pregnant, postpartum), while some animals were treated with corticosterone to mimic the psychiatric symptoms of PPD.
